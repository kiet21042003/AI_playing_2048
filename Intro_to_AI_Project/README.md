# Intro to AI Project
Based on the popular game 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
Making use of the Tkinter library, we developed a Python AI version for the original 2048 game. This uses expectimax optimization, along with a highly-efficient bitboard representation to search upwards of 10 million moves per second on recent hardware. There are 3 versions of heuristic function (detail was given in the attached report).

## Structure of the directory
- This source code includes 3 different folders with respect to each type of heuristic function.
- Each subdirectory includes a README file in which the instruction is contained.

# README - 2048 | Introduction to AI Project
This is the folder for the third version of heuristic function.

## Notes

- The upper bound of the `MAX_DEPTH` of the used expecimax algorithm was set to `2` by default. 
- User can change this parameter by changing the value of `MAX_DEPTH` (in `ai.py`)

## Execute the code

### Using executable file
- User can run the code directly using the executable file `2048.exe`
- The code run in this case will have the `MAX_DEPTH = 2`
### Run Python script
- User can run the file `main_gui.py` directly on the terminal to see the AI in action
- Open *Visual Studio Code* (or the terminal if Python was added to the *PATH*), `cd` to the `2048_AI_ver3` directory and run the command `python main_gui.py`

## Data storage
- The result will be stored in the file `data.csv`
